# CLIBS

C single file library that I've rewrited.

## Purpose

Even if all those libs already exist, I take some pleasure on rewriting those. 

The goal is to train myself in C and to try to write well written, reusable single file libs following some of the good convention that have been established.

All the libs are self documented in the .h file and examples are shown for each one.

> [!WARNING]
> Those libs are written in my free time, I can't assure they answer your need and they may not be maintained are working as intended.
> You them at your own risk

## Requirement 

- *gcc*
